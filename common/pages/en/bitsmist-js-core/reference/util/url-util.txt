======URLUtil======

=====Overview=====

URLUtil is a utility class that performs URL-related tasks.
=====Methods=====

====buildQuery(options)====

''Type:String'' ''Static''

Generates the query part of a URL from the object given in the argument. Each key and value is URLEncoded. If an item in the options is an array, each element is concatenated with a comma.

===Parameters===

^Parameter^Type^Description^
|options \\ ''Required''|Object|The URL query parameter object.|

===Return Value===

Returns the URL query string. If the query string is not empty, a leading ? is prepended to the query string.

----

====buildURL(routeInfo, options)====

''Type:String'' ''Static''

Generates a URL based on the specified route information object.

First, "href" is used as a whole URL if the "href" key exists in the route info object, otherwise "pathname" and the current base URL (document.baseURI) are used to generate a URL. "pathname" can be either an absolute or a relative path. If neither "href" or "pathname" exists in the route info object, the current URL is used.

Then,  if any of the following, “protocol”, “username”, “password”, “host”, “hostname”, “port”, “search” or "hash" are included in the route info object, the URL is modified by those parameters.

Finally, if the route info object includes the "queryParameters", the query part of the URL is overwritten by the query generated by "queryParameters". If the "mergeParameters" option is set to True, the query part is merged into the current URL's query parameters.
